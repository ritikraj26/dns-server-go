In this project, I've build a DNS server that's capable of parsing and
creating DNS packets, responding to DNS queries, handling various record types
and doing recursive resolve.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have `go (1.24)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.go`.
